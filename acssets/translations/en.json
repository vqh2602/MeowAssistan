Antihistamines for cats are not always safe, especially when your cat may be allergic to allergy medications. Here are some precautions you should take to ensure your precious pet is treated safely: \uD83D\uDC8A Avoid gel capsules, which contain solvents (dissolving media) that can cause irritation allergic or even toxic to cats. \uD83D\uDCA1 Pay attention to the active ingredients of the medicine you buy. If the medicine contains active ingredients other than diphenhydramine, you need to consult your veterinarian. \uD83D\uDD0E Make sure your cat receives the correct dose according to its correct weight. If in doubt, you can always double check with your vet and triple check using our Benadryl cat dosage calculator!' \uD83C\uDD98 Monitor your cat's behavior and make sure it doesn't experience any adverse side effects.

  "ben_cat_des": "Benadryl is an antihistamine mainly used to relieve the symptoms of an allergic reaction. When exposed to specific allergens (dust, grass, plastic, pollen, fungi, etc.), a cat's immune system can release histamine and other chemicals, which can cause allergy symptoms , such as: - Sneezing - Coughing and wheezing - Itchy skin (excessive scratching and excessive brushing) - Vomiting and diarrhea - Bloating and bloating. Antihistamines, including Benadryl, reduce the body's response to histamine and alleviate the symptoms mentioned above. Besides relieving allergy symptoms, your veterinarian may recommend Benadryl for other medical reasons, such as anxiety and preventing motion sickness and nausea. Note that if your cat is experiencing anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction distinguished by difficulty breathing, facial swelling, convulsions, or collapse), Benadryl may not be able to help - you need to get your cat to the room. nearest vet immediately ----------",

A more yellow color suggests between one and two years of age, while tartar buildup or tooth loss indicates an older cat - Cat's Eye. Kittens usually have bright and sparkling eyes. A few clouds may indicate that your cat is 10 years old or older. Also, the irises of an old cat's eyes appear a bit jagged. - Cat's coat.

  "cat_year_des": "If you're one of the lucky owners of a cat, you're probably wondering if your cat is still a teenager or maybe going through a midlife crisis. Look no further - this cat age calculator will give you all the info you need, converting between cat age and human age. A common misconception is that one year in a cat's life is equivalent to seven human years. In fact, calculating a cat's age is a bit more complicated. Kittens grow quickly when they are young, but as they get older, the aging process slows down. Which means that after a year, your cat is as old as a seven-year-old child, but for older cats, each year is only the equivalent of four human years. Of course, not all cats are the same age. An outdoor cat will generally have a shorter lifespan than an indoor cat. Also, while the typical cat lives about 10-15 years, some breeds age more slowly or faster. However, this cat age calculator will give you a good idea of your cat's seniority.'",
